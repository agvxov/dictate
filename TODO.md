+ mdictate is utterly broken;
   since each argument its own call it fails to keep track of where
   a line actually begins or ends
+ a quoting configuration should be introduced that wraps strings and chars in ""/'',
   escapes quoting characters and converts control characters to something human readable
   (probably carot notation)
+ debug\_* variants should be added; i will have to decide between DEBUG and NDEBUG
