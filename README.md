# Dictate
> The Ãœberfunktion of printing.

Dictate is a family of print functions tailored,
but not limited to the cli.

It resolves irratating `<stdio.h>` inconsistencies,
has a convenient way to handle colours
and adds margin support.

For the full documentation,
please consult the [header itself](dictate.h).
